# kubernetes-controller-tutorial
This repository offers an opinionated guide to building Kubernetes controllers. I'll share the best practices and design patterns I've found useful through maintaining open-source projects like:

1. [Kubernetes add-on controller](http://github.com/projectsveltos/addon-controller)
2. [K8s-cleaner](https://github.com/gianlucam76/k8s-cleaner)
